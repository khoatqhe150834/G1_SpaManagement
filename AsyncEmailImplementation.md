# Asynchronous Email Implementation

## Overview

Implemented threaded email sending to improve user experience and server performance in the password reset functionality.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the password reset process was blocking the web request thread while sending emails, which could take 5-30 seconds depending on SMTP server response times. This caused:

- Poor user experience (long waiting times)
- Blocked server threads (reduced concurrent request capacity)
- Potential timeouts in browsers
- Scalability issues under load

## Solution Implemented

### 1. AsyncEmailService (`src/java/service/email/AsyncEmailService.java`)

- **Thread Pool**: Uses a fixed thread pool (5 threads) for email operations
- **Fire-and-Forget**: `sendPasswordResetEmailFireAndForget()` method for non-blocking operation
- **Future-based**: `sendPasswordResetEmailAsync()` for when you need results
- **Callback Support**: `sendPasswordResetEmailWithCallback()` for custom success/failure handling
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout for email operations
- **Proper Shutdown**: Graceful thread pool shutdown on application stop

### 2. Application Lifecycle Management (`src/java/listener/ApplicationLifecycleListener.java`)

- **Servlet Context Listener**: Properly shuts down thread pool when application stops
- **Resource Management**: Prevents thread leaks and ensures clean shutdown

### 3. Updated ResetPasswordController (`src/java/controller/ResetPasswordController.java`)

- **Async Integration**: Uses AsyncEmailService instead of blocking EmailService
- **Immediate Response**: User gets instant feedback without waiting for email delivery
- **Better UX**: Enhanced success message includes spam folder reminder
- **Performance Logging**: Logs email queue operations for monitoring

## Key Benefits

### Performance Improvements

- **Response Time**: Password reset requests now respond in ~100ms instead of 5-30 seconds
- **Throughput**: Server can handle more concurrent password reset requests
- **Resource Usage**: No more blocked threads waiting for SMTP responses

### User Experience

- **Instant Feedback**: Users see confirmation immediately
- **No Timeouts**: Eliminates browser timeout issues
- **Better Messaging**: Clearer instructions including spam folder check

### Scalability

- **Thread Pool**: Controlled resource usage with fixed thread pool
- **Queue Management**: Built-in queue for handling multiple email requests
- **Monitoring**: Status reporting for email queue health

## Usage Patterns

### Fire-and-Forget (Recommended for Reset Passwords)

```java
asyncEmailService.sendPasswordResetEmailFireAndForget(email, token, contextPath);
```

### With Future (When you need to track completion)

```java
Future<Boolean> emailTask = asyncEmailService.sendPasswordResetEmailAsync(email, token, contextPath);
// Later: check if done with emailTask.isDone()
```

### With Callbacks (For complex workflows)

```java
asyncEmailService.sendPasswordResetEmailWithCallback(email, token, contextPath,
    () -> System.out.println("Email sent successfully"),
    () -> System.out.println("Email failed")
);
```

## Configuration

### Thread Pool Size

Currently set to 5 threads. Adjust based on:

- Email sending volume
- SMTP server capacity
- Server resources

### Timeout Settings

- **Email Operation**: 30 seconds
- **Shutdown Wait**: 60 seconds

## Monitoring

### Queue Status

```java
String status = asyncEmailService.getEmailQueueStatus();
// Returns: "Email Queue - Active: 2, Queued: 5, Completed: 100"
```

### Logging

- **INFO**: Email queued for sending
- **WARNING**: Email send failures
- **SEVERE**: Critical errors in email service

## Production Considerations

### Error Handling

- Failed emails are logged but don't interrupt user flow
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms for critical emails
- Monitor failed email rates

### Monitoring

- Track email queue size and completion rates
- Set up alerts for high failure rates
- Monitor thread pool health

### Future Enhancements

- Database queue for email retry logic
- Priority queuing for different email types
- Integration with external email services (SendGrid, etc.)
- Email template management
- Delivery status tracking

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Jakarta EE servlet APIs (jakarta.servlet.\*)
- Thread-safe implementation
- Proper resource cleanup on application shutdown
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
